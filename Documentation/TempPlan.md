I need an enemy at maybe a character state like using state marching like alive and dead and after the player was dead I want the game to restart so I may need a game system that is about the game's status like replay and in the menu screen or something but I have no idea so basically I want the player to touch something like spark and dead and I'm going to use the attack system like a killer or enemy so when player touch or collide with the enemy the player were dead.
